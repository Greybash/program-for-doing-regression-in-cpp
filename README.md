# program-for-doing-regression-in-cpp
It is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent (explanatory) variables. A regression model is able to show whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the explanatory variables.

This program can slove / fit any degree of polynomial.

What is Polynomial Regression?
Polynomial Regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variables are modeled in the nth degree polynomial.

Polynomial Regression models are usually fit with the method of least squares.The least square method minimizes the variance of the coefficients,under the Gauss Markov Theorem.

Polynomial Regression is a special case of Linear Regression where we fit the polynomial equation on the data with a curvilinear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
